# Configuration reference

This page includes reference information about the nRF Connect for Desktop configuration.

## File system location

nRF Connect for Desktop stores apps in the following directory:

- Linux or macOS: `$HOME/.nrfconnect-apps`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.nrfconnect-apps`

Other files, like configurations, logs, or the `nrfutil` sandboxes are stored in
the following directory:

- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/nrfconnect`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nrfconnect` or `$HOME/.config/nrfconnect`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\nrfconnect`

### Official apps

Official apps are uploaded to `files.nordicsemi.com`. When clicking on **Install**
in the launcher, the app tarball is downloaded and extracted to
`.nrfconnect-apps/node_modules`.

### Local apps

Apps that are unofficial or in development are retrieved from the
`.nrfconnect-apps/local` directory. Adding an app here will make it appear in
the nRF Connect for Desktop launcher, so that you can test it.

## Properties in package.json

The following `package.json` properties are required for nRF Connect for Desktop apps:

| Property                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                             | The name used to identify the app. The recommended naming convention is `pc-nrfconnect-<appname>`, as this makes it easier to identify it as an nRF Connect for Desktop app.                                              |
| `displayName`                      | The name shown in the nRF Connect for Desktop launcher and in the app's window title.                                                                                                                                     |
| `description`                      | The description shown in the nRF Connect for Desktop  launcher.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `version`                          | The current version of the app. Should be a valid [semantic versioning string](http://semver.org/). The nRF Connect launcher will display an upgrade button when new versions of the app are made available on the server. |
| `engines.nrfconnect`               | The nRF Connect for Desktop version (or versions) the app supports. Should be a valid [semantic versioning range](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges). The launcher shows a warning if this is missing or incompatible.                |
| `files`                            | The files to include when publishing the app on the npm registry. Make sure that this contains everything the app needs at runtime, for example code, icon, and resources.                                           |
| `nrfConnectForDesktop.html`        | The HTML file the launcher displays in the app window, when loading the app. When using the default configurations from `pc-nrfconnect-shared`, this is `dist/index.html`.                                    |
| `nrfConnectForDesktop.nrfutilCore` | Which [core version of nRF Util](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/nrfutil-core/CHANGELOG.html) the app depends upon. This defaults to v8.0.0.                                                        |
| `nrfConnectForDesktop.nrfutil.*`   | For each command of nRF Util the app uses (usually at least `device`), the version of this command to use.                                                                                                     |

Other than these, we also recommend setting at least `license`, `homepage`,
`author`, and `repository.url`.

## App icon

To have a custom preferred icon displayed for your app in the nRF Connect for Desktop launcher and the app's window title, add an `icon.svg` (preferred) or an `icon.png` file in the app directory.

The icon is displayed at 40x40 pixels in the nRF Connect for Desktop launcher, so make sure
the icon is displaying in good quality when using this size.

If no such file exists, the default nRF Connect for Desktop icon is used.

## Dependencies

Usually, apps depend on other modules from the npm registry. Dependencies
can be specified in the app's `package.json` file.

As a general rule, apps should use `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies`
when possible. This keeps the app's size to a minimum. At build time,
esbuild bundles all the code that the app needs to run, so the dependencies
are normally only needed at build time.

Some modules may not be possible to bundle with esbuild. This could be native
modules or modules that use some special syntax that esbuild does not support.
In this case, the module should be added to `dependencies` instead of
`devDependencies`, and also added to `bundledDependencies` so that it is
included in the tarball that is published to npm.

## esbuild

`pc-nrfconnect-shared` provides the [`run-esbuild`](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-shared/blob/caf1908a3ebf7f9a0a9b0ac0c660ab243db02687/package.json#L15) script to run esbuild with a configuration that is ready to use.
The [nRF Connect boilerplate app defines `scripts` to run esbuild](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-boilerplate/blob/f337484c811d4725b4cff33dd2da4cd6e185f2ea/package.json#L24-L27) to build the app.

Normally, you do not need to edit this, but you are free to bundle apps in another way if that suits you better.

### External modules

Apps can import a few modules from nRF Connect for Desktop.
The default esbuild configuration ignores these by [adding them as `external`](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-shared/blob/caf1908a3ebf7f9a0a9b0ac0c660ab243db02687/scripts/esbuild-renderer.ts#L51-L62),
as they are available at runtime. The same is automatically done for any `dependencies` from `package.json`.

## Release notes

All official apps must have a file [`Changelog.md`](./changelogs). When
publishing apps, that changelog is automatically uploaded and users see it in
the launcher as release notes of the app.
