# Contributing guidelines

Feel free to fork the repository of any nRF Connect for Desktop and clone it for secondary development or feature contributions.

You are encouraged to:

* Open issues related to source code and documentation using GitHub Issues.
* Submit a pull request with feature contributions or bug fixes.

If you open a pull request, you need to sign Nordic Semiconductor's Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
You can see instructions for doing this after having submitting your first pull request.
You only need to sign the CLA once, so if you have already done it for another project in the [NordicSemiconductor
GitHub organization](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor), you are good to go.
